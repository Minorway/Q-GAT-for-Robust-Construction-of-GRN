---
  • We propose Q-GAT for the task of GRNs, which is the pioneer in addressing the stability issue of constructing GRNs. Instead of a modification for network structures, our innovation is at the neuronal level from the perspective of neuronal diversity. <br>
  • Systematic experiments show that under different levels of adversarial noises, the proposed Q-GAT is superior to its competitors in terms of stability in constructing GRNs.<br>
  • Not just satisfied with the superior performance ofQ-GAT, we move one step further to analyze why Q-GAT is more robust aided by the SNR and interpretability analyses.<br>
