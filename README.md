Quadratic Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) for Robust Construction of Gene Regulatory Networks
===
This repository provides scripts to reproduce the results in the paper "Quadratic Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) for Robust Construction of Gene Regulatory Networks", including model training and SNR calculation, etc. In this work,

• We propose Q-GAT for the task of GRNs, which is the pioneer in addressing the stability issue of constructing GRNs. Instead of a modification for network structures, our innovation is at the neuronal level from the perspective of neuronal diversity.
• Systematic experiments show that under different levels of adversarial noises, the proposed Q-GAT is superior to its competitors in terms of stability in constructing GRNs.
• Not just satisfied with the superior performance ofQ-GAT, we move one step further to analyze why Q-GAT is more robust aided by the SNR and interpretability analyses.
